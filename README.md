# AgileRetrospective
Retrospective of group project making a slideshow for vacation packages.

<h1>How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?</h1>
  For any product to be successful, we need to understand what the client wants and the reasons why they want it; we need to understand *their* goals more than just knowing their goals. With this mindset, our Product Owner was taking notes on what the clients were asking for. Some examples of interpreting their wants are:
<ul>
  <li>They want to have the cost of a trip plainly visible. This is because they want to cater to people with restricted budgets.
  <li>They want to have trips tagged and filtered by tags. They know their customers may have certain interests they want to find faster.
  <li>They want their trip suggestions to be based on trips the user's taken before. Their clientelle are regulars with profiles, and they know they can sell more trips to them if they already know what they want.
</ul>
  Since we know what they want as clients, we drafted user stories to set our success criteria. The classic "I'm a <x>, and I want <y> so I can <z>" kind of stories. The cost filter would have a story like "I'm a strict saver, and I want to find cheap vacation packages so I can have some me-time without breaking the bank." The success criteria would be having the costs plainly visible and being able to remove trips outside of a determined price range.
